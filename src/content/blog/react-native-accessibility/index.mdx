When I joined BAM, I realized on my first projects that **accessibility** was
something often forgotten on **mobile apps**. In fact, taking care of your app
accessibility can be quite a **challenge**, especially on mobile apps: Very few
documentation exists on this topic for **React Native** developers. So it’s time
to correct that!

If you are a new React Native **developer** and are asking yourself about
**accessibility**, or if you are already an expert in hooks and contexts, but
you never deep dive into the subject, this article is for you!

## Why should we care about Accessibility?

Let’s start with the first question about **accessibility**: why? Maybe you
already know the reasons why accessibility is important, but let's recap them
here.

First, accessibility targets two types of users. The first one we think about
are users with permanent disabilities, like blindness, deafness, and so on. It
is difficult to determine the exact number of people affected, but
[the ONU](https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1) estimates
that it affects one person out of six in the world.

In France, where we have more accurate statistics, if we add other accessibility
problems like color-blindness or dyslexia (that are not recognized as
disabilities), the number grows up to 1/3 of the population!

  15 are color-blind, 30 have dyslexia, 17 have locomotor disabilities, and 23
  have cognitive disabilities](./disabilities-in-france.png)

    disabilities and cognitive disabilities. Source:

The second type of affected users are… everyone else! Accessibility issues can
impact anyone, even those without handicaps. You can have difficulties to see
color contrasts (when you use your phone in direct sunlight for example), or to
listen the audio of your video in the subway… The list is very long!

These situations are called **_Situational Disabilities_** : you are
experiencing a disability, like visual impairment or deafness, because of the
context you are in or your environment. It can happen to everyone and produces,
from the point of view of an app, the same result as a regular disability.

Last but not least, if you try to convince your boss to tackle accessibility:
the **LAW** 😱. More and more countries in the world make policies to enforce
companies to make their product accessible. For example, the
[European Accessibility Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Accessibility_Act)
mandates that nearly all public digital services available in Europe must be
accessible by 2025, if you didn’t hear about that.

## What is Accessibility for Mobile Apps?

There are two main categories of accessibility issues on smartphones. The first
one concerns the **_design_** or **_features_** issues. It can be, for example:

- Contrasts: you should check that all your contrasts meet
  [the AA criteria](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast);
- Colors: [information should not be conveyed by color alone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Use_of_color);
- Texts: texts should be easily
  [understandable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Understandable)
  and easy to read (for example, using larger spaces between lines and a
  sans-serif font);
- Audio: audio content should have a written alternative (for example,
  subtitles and transcription on a video).

If you wish to knew more details about this type of issues, you can check
others articles to learn more about it: [The power of accessibility personas in
web development](https://blog.theodo.com/2023/06/empathy-accessibility-personas/)
and [Improve the accessibility of your digital product for a better user
experience](https://www.bam.tech/en/article/comment-ameliorer-laccessibilite-de-votre-produit-numerique-pour-une-meilleure-experience-utilisateur).

The second category, which is more relevant for **mobile developers**, is
about **_technology issues_**. These are specific accessibility features,
already available in the Android and iOS systems, that your app should be able
to support. Let’s focus on the 3 most important accessibility features:

- **Font Size Control**: this setting will enlarge fonts to make them more
  legible for people with vision loss, or for users who look at their phone
  from a distance (e.g., bicycle delivery drivers).
- **Screen Reader**: it allows a user to use their device by reading the
  content of the screen, often used by blindness people. It is called _TalkBack_
  on _Android_ and _VoiceOver_ on _iOS_.
- **Switch Control**: it allows controlling the device with programming keys
  (like _Volume UP_ and _Volume DOWN_ buttons), instead of touching the screen,
  for people with motor disorders. It is also very useful if your screen is
  broken!

If you want to learn how to use all these accessibility features of a phone,
please check out these guides:

- [_iOS a11y guidelines: VoiceOver_ by Orange](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/mobile/ios/voiceover/)

## How to check my App for Accessibility?

Indeed, testing your app with each of this setting can be very time-consuming
and boring. That’s why we have some **tools** to help us deal with
accessibility!

Let me introduce you to your new friend, which will greatly help you during your
accessibility journey: the [**Accessibility Inspector**](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/257/)!
It is already installed by default with Xcode, so you can just search it with
Spotlight to open it.

The Accessibility Inspector comes with 3 features:

- **The Inspection Tab**: easily tests the internal structure of your app, used
  for the Screen Reader and the Switch Control functionalities.
- **The Audit Tab**: scans the screen to find common accessibility errors, like
  weak contrasts, missing labels, buttons that are too small, etc.
- **The Settings Tab**: shortcuts to quickly update the accessibility settings
  and see the results on your app, like the _Font Size_ setting.

Amazing, right? 🤩 Now, you're ready to check your app for accessibility!

If you also want to check your app on a real device without using a simulator,
you can install the [**Accessibility Scanner**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)
for Android. It allows you to run larger audits on your app, and offers more
checks and solutions in my opinion. And if your app is published, you can also
find automatic analysis from the _Accessibility Scanner_ in the _Play Console_!

## How does React Native support Accessibility ?

Now that you’re aware of the theory and tools, let’s see how you can implement
all of that in **React Native**. We will only focus on screen reader and switch
control, since the other accessibility issues mainly concern the design of your
app.

### The Accessible Components

Accessible components are at the core of React Native accessibility. They are
React components that can be focused by the user, and always possess a **role**
and a **label**. A component is considered as **accessible** if its `accessible`
property is set to `true`.

```jsx
<Pressable
  // ensure this is accessible by the screen reader
  // optional for Pressable, since default value is already true
  accessible
  // declare the role to "button"
  // this is mandatory for Pressable, since it has no default role
  accessibilityRole="button"
  // declare a custom label to override the default label of "Icon"
  accessibilityLabel="Validate"
>
  <Text>Validate</Text>
  <Icon />
</Pressable>
```

It is worth noting that there are some limitations in React Native (the latest
version is 0.72 at the time of writing):

- you can’t nest accessible components (e.g., a button in a clickable card or a
  link in a paragraph);
- the reading sequence cannot be changed: the screen reader will read the
  elements in the same order as they appear in the source code.

By default, it is preferable to always add the `accessibilityRole` and
`accessibilityLabel` props. Even if they have default values, you can end up
with some unexpected behavior if you omit them.

There are also some other properties you can use to make your app more
user-friendly. The most important ones are `accessibilityState` and
`accessibilityValue`, which can indicate the different states of a component,
for example when a button is disabled or in a loading state (check
[the docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitystate)
for more details). There is also `accessibilityHint`, which gives more precision
about what does the component when actioned (the label should remain short).

Feel free to check out the
[React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility)
for more properties!

### A full example: the Checkbox

Now let’s see a more complex example to sum up all what we’ve learned!
Here is a simple checkbox, with a loading state, made fully accessible:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Pressable, Text } from "react-native";
import { CheckedBoxIcon, UncheckedBoxIcon } from "icons";

const CheckBoxTermsAndConditions = () => {
  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const handlePress = () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsChecked((checked) => !checked);
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 500);
  };

  return (
    <Pressable
      onPress={handlePress}
      disabled={isLoading}
      accessibilityRole="checkbox"
      accessibilityLabel="I agree to the terms and conditions of the application."
      accessibilityState={{ checked: isChecked, disabled: isLoading }}
      accessibilityValue={{ text: isLoading ? "Loading" : undefined }}
      style={{ flexDirection: "row", alignItems: "center", gap: 4, margin: 20 }}
    >
      {isChecked ? (
        <CheckedBoxIcon color={isLoading ? "lightgrey" : "black"} />
      ) : (
        <UncheckedBoxIcon color={isLoading ? "lightgrey" : "black"} />
      )}
      <Text>I agree to the terms and conditions</Text>
    </Pressable>
  );
};
```

And here is the result 🥳:

<img
  src={checkboxDemo.src}
  alt="Example of usage of the Checkbox component"
  style={{ maxWidth: "500px" }}
/>

So what have we done here? First, we wrap the checkbox icon and the associated
label in a single **Pressable component**: this allows users with mobility
issues to check or uncheck the component by pressing the label.

Then, I add the **Role** of the component for screen readers, `"checkbox"`, and
the **Label** that would be read in place of the checkbox label. This way, we
ensure that the icon label will not be read by the screen reader, and it also
allows us to use a clearer text for screen reader users.

Note that we did NOT indicate the word “Checkbox” in the label. This is because
it will be automatically added by the screen reader using the **role** prop, so
we don’t need to add it twice!

We also did not add the prop `accessible={true}`: this is because _Pressables_,
unlike **_Views_**, are already **accessible components** by default! This is
useful in most cases, but can be problematic if you nest _Pressable_ components.

Finally, we add some custom properties specific for the states. The
`accessibilityState` property will indicate to the user if the checkbox is
ticked or not, and the `accessibilityValue` indicates if the checkbox is
loading.

And that’s all, we made a **fully accessible** checkbox!

## Conclusion

**Accessibility** can be very tricky to deal with: there are a lot of things to
check and quite a few lines of code to add! Hopefully, you can use **default
components** from React Native or components libraries to avoid re-writing all
your components from scratch. React Native and Android or iOS are also smart
enough to add **labels** and **roles** by default, even if you did nothing, but
they are still limited!
